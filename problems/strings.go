/*
Problem 2: given a string, find if there are same two characters in a row
Always: safety first return if the string is empty

// initial stuff
-  Convert String to Lowercase:
-  Check other stuff as necessary, like regex patterns for other things you want to avoid

// Initialize Variables:
positionCharCount to hold the final result.
tempPcc to temporarily hold data for comparison.
Two pointers, pointer1 and pointer2, are initialized.
pointer1 starts at the beginning of the string, and pointer2 starts at the second character.
Iterate Through the String while pointer 2 is less than the length of the string since pointer is index based

Compare Characters:

If the characters at pointer1 and pointer2 are the same, Update tempPcc with
the current character, its starting index, and the count of how many times it has been repeated consecutively so far.
then, increment pointer 2 to check the next character.

Update Final Result:
After finding a sequence of repeating characters,
Check if this sequence is longer than any previously stored sequence
If it is, positionCharCount is updated with the information from tempPcc.

Handle Non-Repeating Characters:
If the characters at pointer1 and pointer2 are different,
pointer1 is moved to pointer2's position, and pointer2 is incremented.

Return the struct:
