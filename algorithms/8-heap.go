/*
* Heap is a data structure mainly used for priority queue.
* In normal queue, we take out the one that came in first,
but in priority queue, we take out what's important first.
* Also, heap can be expressed as a *complete tree*. A cmolplete tree,
  is a tree where all the nodes are full except for the leaves (the lowest level)
  where all the filled nodes are to the left.
           50
         /    \
       30      40
      /  \    /  \
    20   15  35  25
   /  \
  10  5

* Max heap ðŸ‘†, where each parent key is larger than it's children
* Min heap, where each parent has the smallest of the keys. Just opposite of the max heap
---

* Heap is illustrated and operates as a tree but is acatually an array under the hood.
for the tree above, the array would look like this
heapArray := []int{50, 30, 40, 20, 15, 35, 25, 10, 5}
* To calculate the index of children based on the parent's index,

indexOfLeftChild = parentIndex * 2 + 1
indexofRightChild = parentIndex * 2 + 2 (or add 1 to left child)
ðŸ‘† this is what we will use to calculate and find the child and parents

--- Insert
To insert a node to the tree,
* first put the node to the bottom right of the tree. The last index in the array
* Then, we compare the inserted number with it's parent.
  * if the parent is smaller, we swap the position with it's parent.
  * recurse the step until the parent is larger then the inserted item.

--- Extraction
To extract the highest key extract the root
* first replace the root with the last item in the array. In our example, we would replace 50 with 5.
* Compare the new root (5) with it's children, if any of the child is larger than the root, swap places.
* recurse until the node's children are both smaller than the parent

--- Time Complexity O(log n) -- n is the number of items in the array
Time complexity of the heap depends on the worst part about this data structure.
In heap, the worst part about the operation is traversing the tree up and down when an item is
* extracted
* inserted
In these two operations, the larger the height, the longer time it takes.
As the number of items increase, the height increases but not in a linear fashion.
It increases with log n
